# TP8 : THREADS
---

Welcom

## Exercise 1 :fire:.
---

`Overview :` In this exercise we want to create a simple application or program for 
implementing the execution of the multiple threads,
and see how we can run blocks of code in parallel way (or in the same time).


**Tasks**
---

```bash
-> Create Classe Talkative with a constractor for inserting int number attribute.
-> Implemente the Runnable class to execute a task using the run method.
-> Execute a task using run method for showing the int with 100 time(we see after the exxecution of this for better understanding).
-> Create 10 instances in the main to test Thread execution.
-> Conclusion.
```

---


## Let's Code ðŸ’¸
---

### Class Talkative
---
In this code I Implement the Runnable and as you can see the private attribute number to test with it the purpose of the exercise.


```java

class Talkative implements Runnable {
    private final int number;

    public Talkative(int number) {
        this.number = number;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
            System.out.println("Talkative instance " + number + " - Message " + i);

        }
    }
}

//Runnable is an interface to make a task executed by thread.
//THread is to run the task concurrently at the same time
//in the conclusion we use thread to made separate block of tasks and we use the start to execute or implement all in the same time
```

### Main
---

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            Thread thread = new Thread(new Talkative(i));
            thread.start();
        }
    }

}

//The output show different instances of printed and mixed order talkative ,they are printed simultaneity, so we can conclude that when we execute the run in Runnable interface to

```


**After Running !**

It's a long output, don't worry, I will explain so as not overwhelming or misunderstand.

```bash
In the output we will see each number from 1 to 10 and is repeated 100 times, but in ,arbitrary order,
This is the purpose of the exercise I describe what I made!
```

*This is the picture of the Execution!*

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64beed09-ab08-4c35-833b-55d153d8e293)

it's the output starting from `int 0 with the 100 times repeatedly` and you can see their disorder.

## Exercise 2 :fire:.
---

### Overview
In this exercise, we aim to demonstrate the use of multithreading in Java to calculate the sum of an array by dividing the workload among multiple threads.

---

### **Tasks**

```bash
-> Create a class `Sommeur` to calculate the sum of a sub-array.
-> Divide the array into equal parts for the threads to process.
-> Use `ExecutorService` to manage threads.
-> Combine the results from all threads to get the total sum.
-> Test the program with a 100-element array.
-> Conclude with observations about multithreading and performance.
```

## Let's Code ðŸŽ±:

### Class Sommeur.
---
This class computes the sum of a portion of the array.

```java
class Sommeur implements Runnable {
    private final int[] array;
    private final int start;
    private final int end;
    private int somme = 0;

    public Sommeur(int[] array, int start, int end) {
        this.array = array;
        this.start = start;
        this.end = end;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (int i = start; i < end; i++) {
            somme += array[i];
        }
    }

    public int getSomme() {
        return somme;
    }
}
```

### Main.
---

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
        // Create an array of integers
        int[] array = new int[100];
        Arrays.fill(array, 1); // Fill array with 1s for simplicity

        // Define the number of threads
        int numThreads = 4;
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(numThreads);

        // Calculate range per thread
        int range = array.length / numThreads;
        Sommeur[] sommeurs = new Sommeur[numThreads];
        Future<?>[] futures = new Future<?>[numThreads];

        // Assign tasks to threads
        for (int i = 0; i < numThreads; i++) {
            int start = i * range;
            int end = (i == numThreads - 1) ? array.length : start + range;
            sommeurs[i] = new Sommeur(array, start, end);
            futures[i] = executor.submit(sommeurs[i]);
        }

        // Wait for all threads to finish
        for (Future<?> future : futures) {
            future.get(); // Ensures the thread has finished
        }

        // Compute the total sum
        int totalSum = 0;
        for (Sommeur sommeur : sommeurs) {
            totalSum += sommeur.getSomme();
        }

        // Shutdown the executor
        executor.shutdown();

        // Print the result
        System.out.println("Total sum of array: " + totalSum);
    }
}

```

## Execution Output
After running the program:

You will see the following output:
