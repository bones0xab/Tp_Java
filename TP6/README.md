### Relations ‚ò∫Ô∏è:
- **1:N Relation**:
  - Une instance de `Departement` peut √™tre associ√©e √† plusieurs instances de `Professeur`.
  - Impl√©ment√©e via la cl√© √©trang√®re `id_depart` dans la table `Professeur` qui fait r√©f√©rence √† `id_depart` dans la table `Departement`.

### Goal ü•Ö:
---
In this Practical activity we want to make an application for manipulate some professors and departments using javaFX,
First of all, the application must be runned by javaFX and scene Builder , finally Mysql for handling the data !

### Functionalities ‚ñ∂Ô∏è:
---

As we see in the MLD and MCD, the application must include features like addProfessor addDepartment and the other requested functionalities.

**Professor requirement üë®‚Äçüè´:**
```bash
-> addProfessor
-> deleteProfessor
-> updateProfessor
-> affectDeptoProfessor
-> searchProfessor
-> showProfessors
```

**Departement requirement üè¨:**
```bash
-> addDepartment
-> deleteDepartement
-> affectDepartement
-> updateDepartement
-> ShowprofessorbyDepartment
```

## Databases Screens üñºÔ∏è:
---
After some time I create a basic database for an example to show how the things work first, as well to stick to the requirements of the Practical Work !

*This is the pictures or the screens of the DB locally.*

# Code ‚ò£Ô∏è:
---

*For avoiding the overwealming the codes are in a directories and also the FXMLs and all required stuff.*

# Screens of Real scenario.
---
**After click on run, we see this screen shows up, it's the main screen of the project, where we have two choices, 
go to professor operations or department operations.**

**After the decision of choosing the professors operations the program go from FXML of the main interface into the FXML of professors,
as we can see in the figure, it shows a tableview with pre-defined database (it s the basic example I can give for better understanding !) with the columns and the names etc ... .
Also we see some buttons for the configuration and do some changements.
I will resume the work in this sentence : I will test them all !**

### AffectDepartment
For this functionality, I made my thinking to affect departments after seeing the departments available and assigning by Id, I don't use names cause it's easy.

### Update.
The last button it's just for update tableview (It's automatically , but in the case where you see something fixed you can click on it).
