# Exercise 1 ☠️:

`Overview`: In the first exercise, we want to develop a basic program that will give all the information related to the files and directories. The requirements for this exercise are to show the `PATH` and the `type`, as well as the permissions for the target elements.

**This is an example of the output :**

```bash
..\xampp\htdocs\tp1\index.php <FICH> rw-
..\xampp\htdocs\tp1\accueil.htm <FICH> rw-
..\xampp\htdocs\tp1\images < DIR > rw-
```

-> ▶️ Let's begin
